# AISnakeGame
A classic snake game with an AI agent that gradually improves performance through CNN and genetic algorithm  
All agents move randomly at the beginning, but they are rewarded for eating the apple and are punished for dying. If they live for too long without eating, they are automatically destroyed.  
Agents with the most reward are more likely to reproduce, carrying on their weights and biases to the next generation.
